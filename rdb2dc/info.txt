RDB2DC is a PHP class to convert scholarly publications from a MySQL relational
database to DSpace's import format (which is based on Dublin Core).

We are using this tool to convert data from a home-grown publications database
into a new centralized institutional repository using DSpace.

At a high level, this tool takes separate database tables such as Publications,
Journals, Authors, and Subjects and combines that data into the full record
for each item. It also prepares additional files and folders needed by the
DSpace import process.

Our use of this tool looks like this:

- Load a copy of the relational database into MySQL on the dev server
- Perform any needed manual data massaging/formatting
- Alter the Select queries and format functions to match this database structure
- Run this tool from command-line
- Copy the resulting import/ folder to the DSpace server
- Use the dspace command-line import tool on that import/ folder
